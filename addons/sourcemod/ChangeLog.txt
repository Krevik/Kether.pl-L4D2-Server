	Included requests by @Ejziponken, @PeterPan and @penalte.
	 - Added "sm_restart_empty_min_period" ConVar - Minimum period (in hours) this plugin should wait before the next restarting is allowed (0 - disable, 24 - allow once per day)
	 - Added "sm_restart_empty_limit_hour_start" ConVar - Allow rebooting to be started from this hour only (paired with "*_end" ConVar)
	 - Added "sm_restart_empty_limit_hour_end" ConVar - Allow rebooting until this hour only (paired with "*_start" ConVar)
	 - Added "sm_restart_empty_force_hour_start" ConVar - Start hour for force rebooting (if last reboot happened > 24 hours ago) and somebody leaves during this hour (paired with "*_end" ConVar) (-1 to disable)
	 - Added "sm_restart_empty_force_hour_end" ConVar - End hour for force rebooting (if last reboot happened > 24 hours ago) and somebody leaves during this hour (paired with "*_start" ConVar) (-1 to disable)
	 - Added "sm_restart_empty_server_start_changemap" ConVar - When server restarted, change map to the random one from the file: data/restart_empty_maps.txt (1 - Yes / 0 - No)
	 - Prefer "sm_map" command to change the map (if available).
	 - Removed ConVar "sm_restart_empty_default_map"; use file: "data/restart_empty_maps.txt" instead.
	 - Added "sm_time" command to check server time (taking into account utc delta ConVar).
	 
	See updated 1st post and [B]Suggestions on Setup[/b] Section.
	
	2.1 (28-Nov-2020)
	 - Fixed mistake in a loop, causing server could restart when the last player had an index == 32.
	
	Installation:
	 - ensure you have correct server timezone and synchronized time:
	* e.g. for Linux, you can check timezone using command "timedatectl" and change timezone using command "timedatectl set-timezone TIME-ZONE"
	* or you can set UTC delta correction using ConVar "sm_restart_empty_utc_delta".
	
	2.2 (07-Dec-2020)
	 - Fix for sm_restart_empty_method "3" - all plugins are been unloaded even if method "3" is used (thanks to @zombieland0302 for reporting).
	 - IsMapValid() is replaced by FindMap() to prevent undefined behaviour.
